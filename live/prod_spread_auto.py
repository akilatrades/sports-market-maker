"""Spread maker (spread-maker-v1): two-sided quotes one cent inside wide spreads.

Plan: RESEARCH_LOG.md, "2026-10-22: Spread maker pilot, shadow and small
live (plan)". For open markets in the allowed series whose expected
expiration is 4 to 7 hours away and whose spread is 8c or more, quote a YES
bid one cent above the best YES bid and a NO bid one cent above the best NO
bid, up to five contracts each, post-only, expiring after 65 minutes. Hold
fills to settlement; an order shrinks so that held plus resting contracts on
one side of a market never exceed the per-market cap.

Modes (``--auto`` picks live only when armed, else shadow):
- ``--shadow``: public data only. Writes the quotes it would post to
  STATE/shadow.jsonl and scores them later from Kalshi's public trade prints
  and results. No credentials, no orders.
- ``--live``: real orders, under the shared account lock, inside the shared
  account risk checks (live/shared_account_risk.py) and the pilot caps
  (live/spread_policy.py). Requires KALSHI_ENV=prod,
  ALLOW_PRODUCTION_TRADING=YES, SPREAD_AUTO_ARM=YES, shared-account mode and
  the owner-created marker /etc/market-maker-spread.enabled. The shadow
  ledger keeps running beside it.
- ``--status``: summary of both ledgers.
- ``--preflight``: signed GET-only readiness check (no orders).
- ``--reconcile``: owner-run, signed GET-only resolution of an ambiguous
  order: found in any status (accepted) or absent 10+ minutes later.

Every order and cancel is journaled before it is sent. An exchange HTTP 4xx
refusal is recorded as rejected only after a signed read finds no order with
that client id in any status; any other failure halts all bots until the
owner runs ``--reconcile``. A pass that halts first cancels this bot's
provably owned resting orders. A KILL file in STATE cancels them every pass.
